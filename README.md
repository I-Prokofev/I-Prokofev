Nice to meet you üëã 

**My name is Igor Prokofev**

My way to data analytics was pretty sudden. After receiving one more english certificate I desired to check my language knowledge 
by completing the online specilisation Executive Data Science of Johns Hopkins University. As result, I was so fascinated by 
analytics and business forecasting in my previous job that I decided to change my successful business development manager career 
to data analyst. I am passionate to solve analytical tasks, discover substantial business trends and identify insights. 
Big data is a key to solving of any business task.
